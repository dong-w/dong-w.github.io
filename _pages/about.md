Hi! I am Balan. I am a 4th year Ph. D. candidate in [Dr. Jeff Demuth's Lab](https://www.uta.edu/faculty/demuth) at University of Texas at Arlington. I am interested in understanding the evolution of sex chromosomes and dosage compensation by analyzing next-gen sequencing data using computer programs.

Currently, I am working on understanding the evolution of dosage compensation with a multi-species approach using beetles. With the help of single-cell expression data, I am also curious to know the presence or absence of sex chromosome inactivation during meiosis.

I earned my Bachelors in engineering with a specialization in Biotechnology in May 2016.
