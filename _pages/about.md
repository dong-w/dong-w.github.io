Hi! My name is Dong Wang. I am currently a specially appointed assistant professor in the [Principles of Software engineering and programming Languages Lab (POSL)](https://posl.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/index.html) at Kyushu University, Japan. I received dotoral degree from Nara Institute of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Kenichi Matsumoto ([Software Engineering Laboratory](https://naist-se.github.io/)). Research goals are to directly uncover empirical evidence and extracting knowledge from data recorded in software repositories. My research topics mainly focus on understanding and improving developer collaboration practices such as code review settings and various communication channels.
