Hi! I am a PhD candidate studying the third-year course in Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan. I belong to [Software Engineering Laboratory](https://naist-se.github.io/) under the supervision of Prof. Kenichi Matsumoto. Research goals are to directly uncover empirical evidence and extracting knowledge from data recorded in software repositories. My research topics mainly focus on understanding and improving developer collaboration practices such as code review settings and various communication channels.
